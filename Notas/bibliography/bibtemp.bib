abstract = {Using a time-varying vector error correction model (VECM), we examine the dynamic information shares of the top four Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC) over 1/1/2016â€“31/12/2019. Although steadily decreasing, the information share of BTC is still the largest as of end-2019. The individual dominances of market capitalization and trading volume can explain 20% of variations of the BTC information share but only 6% of those for ETH.}

abstract = {We analyse minute-level multi-dimensional information flows within and between bitcoin spot and derivatives. We show that perpetual swaps and futures traded on the unregulated exchanges Huobi, OKEx and BitMEX are much the strongest instruments for bitcoin price discovery and we examine potential determinants of their leadership strength. Prices on the regulated CME bitcoin futures and the US-based spot exchanges react to, rather than lead, price movements on the unregulated exchanges and they may do so relatively slowly. In a multi-dimensional setting including the main price leaders within futures, perpetuals and spot markets, the CME futures have a very minor effect on price discovery, even less than the spot exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Coinbase. Our findings highlight the persistent problems stemming from inconsistent regulation in bitcoin spot and derivatives markets, including insufficient price stability and lack of resistance to manipulative trading. We conclude that the SEC are correct to maintain such issues as their main concern for bitcoin ETF applications.}

We extend existing literature by performing various tests on efficiency of several cryptocurrencies and additionally link efficiency to measures of liquidity. Cryptocurrencies become less predictable / inefficient as liquidity increases.}
